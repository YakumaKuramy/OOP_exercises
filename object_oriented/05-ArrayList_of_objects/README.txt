Edit the " Main.java " file so it
can be able to use an object
ArrayList. After having the 
ArrayList completed, iterate
through the list two times. 

In the first time use the method 
pow(), passing an Integer to it.

In the second just print the
object, because the obeject
will already have a method
toString() it should be able
to be printed by just by putting
the object on a print function.
